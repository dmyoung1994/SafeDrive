## About
We made SafeDrive for people with a phone or a Mojio device to know when they (or their vehicle) is being driven in a bad area. SafeDrive helps you get to your location with the safest route possible. By leveraging zillow’s apis to get neighbourhood information and accessing localized crime data. By doing so, we are able to determine whether or not the area you are driving or parking in is safe or not. If the area is dangerous, or has had a spike in crime activity, we send you a text message to your phone to let you know that the are is sub-par. By integrating with mojio, we are able to monitor your cars state at all times, even when you’re not in it. 

## Future Plans
The future of SafeDrive envoles a lot of map data. Rerouting the gps on your phone if you are entering into a bad area is definitely high on thepriority list when we have time. If you would like to do it, by all means clone and submit!
